🏏 IPL Score Predictor
🚀 Project Overview
The IPL Score Predictor is an AI-powered system designed to predict the total score of a team in an IPL match based on real match details like venue, teams, and players. Built using deep learning, this project blends cricket insights with smart technology to deliver meaningful predictions for fans, analysts, and developers.

🌟 Key Features
🧹 Data Preprocessing: Cleaned match data, handled missing values, encoded teams and players, and scaled features using MinMaxScaler.

🧠 Model Training: Built a Neural Network using dense layers, ReLU activations, Huber Loss, and Adam Optimizer.

🎯 Evaluation Metrics: Measured accuracy using MAE, MSE, and R² Score.

🧩 Interactive UI: Developed a user-friendly prediction tool with ipywidgets to input match conditions and get live score predictions.

📊 Dataset
Trained the model using historical IPL match data including:

Match venue

Batting and bowling teams

Striker and bowler names

Final team score
